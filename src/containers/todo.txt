Added order Button and made it disabled or not depending on the boolean 
value of the key purchasable in the state. 
Created a new method updatePurchaseState in the BurgerBuilder class component 
which sums all the values of the ingredients keys in the state and in the end
set the new state of purchasable to true if the sum is greater than zero.
(Object.keys , maps, reduce, setState)

Implementing Modal and Backdrop components which are shown by clicking the order button.
The Modal component contains the Order Summary.
We add a new boolean value in the state (purchasing) and we set it to false.
We add two methods in the BurgerBuilder class component (addModalHandler 
& removeModalHandler) which set the state of purchasing true or false.
The two methods are called on clicked by the Build Controls button and 
Backdrop component.
